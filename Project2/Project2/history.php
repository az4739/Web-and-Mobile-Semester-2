            Mostar evolved as an Ottoman frontier town in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as during the Austro-Hungarian period in the 19th and 20th centuries, spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River. Mostar has long been known for its old Turkish homes
            and the Stari Most Bridge, which is named for it. However, during the 1990s violence, most of the ancient town was destroyed, including the Old Bridge, which was created by the renowned architect Sinan. With the help of an international
            scientific commission established by UNESCO, the Old Bridge was recently repaired, and many of the edifices in the Old Town have been restored or rebuilt. With its pre-Ottoman, eastern Ottoman, Mediterranean, and western European architectural
            characteristics, the Old Bridge region is a must-see.

            The settlement is situated in a valley of the Neretva River, between Hum Hill and the bottom of the Vele Mountain, and was formed as an urban structure in the 15th century on the crossing of a river and a land route. According to documented historical
            records, this little village had two towers surrounding the bridge, which was built in 1459. Mostar, the current name, was first attested in 1474 and is derived from "mostari" - bridge guardians. Mostar grew as an Ottoman frontier town
            in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as during the brief Austro-Hungarian period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar has long been noted for its old Turkish homes and the Stari Most, or Old Bridge.</p>

        <p> The historic area of Mostar is the consequence of a number of years of interaction between forces of nature and human ingenuity. The global synthesis of life phenomena represents centuries of cultural continuity: the bridge and its fortifications
            with rich pre-Ottoman archeological strata, religious edifices, residential zones (mahalas), arable grounds, dwellings, bazaar, and its public life in the streets and water. A common life of Muslims, Christians, and Jews was depicted in
            the architecture as a sign of tolerance. Mosques, churches, and synagogues coexisted in this region, demonstrating that Roman Catholic Croats with their Western European culture, Eastern Orthodox Serbs with their Byzantine components,
            and Sephardic Jews coexisted alongside Bosniaks-Muslims for centuries. </p>
