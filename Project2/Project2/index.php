        Now we can continue. Mostar is a small place located in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the heart of Herzegovina to be exact. There it is very hot during summer, very cold during winter, and okay during spring. To learn more about this geographical

    <p> What makes Mostar unique from other cities around the area is its rich history, going through a lot of changes, different types of government and situations. <a href="http://solace.ist.rit.edu/~az4739/final/history.html" class="animation2"><span>HISTORY</span></a></p>
    <p>This made the people of Mostar very interesting and hard to understand. After all they went through, people had to find their inner peace over and over again as their surroundings changed. There are many places scattered around Mostar that serve
        as safe haven to all the people that just want to enjoy life. One of those places is <a href="http://solace.ist.rit.edu/~az4739/final/cafeDeAlma.html" class="animation2"><span>CAFE DE ALMA</span></a></p>
