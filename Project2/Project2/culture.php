        This is a very specific topic that I am not sure I can explain in total. As you enter the city of Mostar, the first thing you notice is the people. If you are not from the southern world you will have some difficulties understanding it. This is a nation
        located on the border of two worlds. The East and the West. It, alongside its people, lived through major historical events, many occupations and wars. Imagine how it is living in such an area.

        So naturally, people have developed a coping mechanism for all those changes, and it is quite weird. That is especially present in the city of Mostar. It helps that Mostar is a pretty small city of 100 000 people at most. Combined with the great hospitality
        and friendliness of citizens, everyone knows each other. The city works like a big community and almost primal like human relations where helping and taking care of others is a primary activity for everyone. Mostar serves as a cradle of culture,
        a place where nations collide and live together for centuries. The people here are divided in so many ways (religious, by beliefs, nation...) and yet they all live homogeneously one with another. As such, they are intricate and fragile. Any
        third party relation can and does mess with the overall life of these people. This is why residents of Mostar have a specific relationship with visitors to their city. It is mocking, sarcastic and almost British like. Can be rude at times.
        It is very specific and connected to the current situation that not a lot of people can understand. It is extremely hilarious to the ones understanding it and not funny at all to those who are witnessing it for the first time.
