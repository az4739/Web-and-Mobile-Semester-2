            Open City Mostar Is a huge project curated by Mostar Rock school. This has been their first year of managing to create such a big project. We are talking about a 23 day festival with 5 stages across the city. The project was created as an idea that the
            whole city becomes a festival area. And they did it. For 23 days the city was on fire. Live gigs, concerts and electronic music could be heard. Everyone enjoyed it. You could see older people having fun on the streets alongside the youth.
            The whole festival was a huge success. It brought colour to the city of Mostar.

        <p>Street Art Festival is an international project with a very specific idea. As its name implies, it is about street art. The organizations of this festival saw Mostar and its many concrete buildings as an empty canvas for art. Bringing many
            graffiti artists from all around the world they managed to paint the city and its war ruins into a colourful masterpiece. Over the years artists from Italy, Spain, France and Argentina have come and left this city with beautiful art pieces
            expanding over meters of the facade. Besides graffiti, the Street art festival also takes care of other forms of expression, such as visual arts and music. This year they had a visual arts performance accompanied by a Berlin-based DJ under
            the old bridge. The whole experience was stunning and a breath of fresh air for the city.</p>
