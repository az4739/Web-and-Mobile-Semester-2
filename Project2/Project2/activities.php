    <p> There is a lot of fun in Mostar. Being a small city, roaming through it is best done with a bike. A 15-minute bike drive can get you through the whole town. There are many nice places to visit so bring some water and start the tour.

        <p>

            Start at Cafe bar Fratello with a coffee. Drinking coffee is a tradition and almost a sport in Mostar. Take as much time as you like. The longer, the better, (you would be surprised how long Mostar citizens drink coffee). When you are set, ride down to
            the old bridge and the old town area. Protected by UNESCO world heritage, a perfect stop. It is touristy during summer so go there at your own risk if you don't like crowds. Next, visit “Bulevar”, a famous coffee drinking place (I told
            you, Mostar people like drinking coffee). After you meet some friends there, I'm sure you will, let them take you to their favorite place. I can guarantee you it will be one of these: Under the old bridge, Hum hill, Fortica or Sjeverni
            logor. IF not, visit those places yourself, you will not regret it.

            <h1>Blagaj</h1>
        </div>

        <p>

            This is a small city within a 20-minute ride from Mostar. It is too beautiful not to see. Blagaj is always a good option. It's Tekija area is beautiful. A walk next to the river where you can sit down and enjoy some local fish from the river. If you are
            feeling adventurous, there is a rock climbing club that can take you on a tour through the Blagaj Via Ferrata. Not that extreme? no worries, Blagaj has you covered. There is a beautiful Stjepan Kosaca fortress which is a 15-minute walk
            uphill from the Blagaj centre. There you can enjoy a beautiful panorama of Hercegovina and learn how it got its name.

            <h1>Climbing</h1>
        </div>

        <p>Herzegovina is famous for its rocky terrain which makes it a perfect playground for rock climbing. There is a rock climbing area 15 minutes from you wherever you are in the city of Mostar. The weather will suit you 9 out of 10 times. There
            are beginner, mid-route and high end climbs. The best part of going on a rock-climbing trip is that you don't have to be climbing at all to enjoy it. The walk to the area, friends around you and the overall feel of adventure and exploration
            is already overwhelming. Climbing is fun but a dangerous sport so you have to be very careful and precise while doing it. No rookie mistakes are allowed here because they can cost you your life. Thankfully, you will never go there alone.
            There are many professional instructors and climbers in Mostar willing to help. You just have to ask</p>
