        Mostar Rock School is a school that rocks, as its slogan implies. It is a musical school created and based in Mostar, BiH. This school offers its students education in musical instruments such as electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, vocals, keys and many
        more. Besides the education, it offers Mostar and its young people a safe neutral environment for meeting new people, hanging out with friends and learning new skills along the way.
    </p>

    <p>But MORS is a lot more than just a music school. Recently they have been creating many events in Mostar that promote local artists and the overall culture of the city. They have managed to open 2 clubs in the last two years that serve as hotpoints
        for concerts, gatherings, stand up comedies and parties in Mostar. K27 and K19 (their names) serve as a breath of fresh air regarding the current cultural situation Mostar is in.
    </p>

    <p> Like most bigger cities in this area, Mostar has been eaten up by commercialized spots with the sole purpose of spending money in them. These two clubs have given themselves the task of reforming the cultural heritage the city of Mostar had.

    <p>K27, ironically named after the famous 27 club of famous artists who committed suicide at the age of 27, sparks with life as the moment it was opened. It is a part of Pavarotti music center serving as a resting / studying place for students of
        music/rock school by day, and as a partying club at night. You can always find good company there. People at the K27 are open minded, very hospitable and always in the mood for a chat and a beer.<a href="https://people.rit.edu/az4739/ISTE240/project1/history.html"><span>HISTORY</span></a>
    </p>

    <p>K19 is its little brother, opened in another cultural landmark of Mostar, OKC Abrasevic (ex cultural center for youth). In the spirit of K27, K19 got its name from the age of death of Abrasevic, a young poet and a socialist after the cultural
        center was named. The same storyline as for K27 implies this club. Since day one it has been a colorful mess hosting everything from a punk concert to a techno rave party. </p>

    <p>
        These clubs are very important for the future of Mostars culture, devoured by closed-minded people that, unfortunately, got their hands on some guns.If you don't want a history lesson but want to learn more about a specific type of humor people from mostar
        have. <a href="https://people.rit.edu/az4739/ISTE240/project1/culture.html"><span>CULTURE</span></a>
