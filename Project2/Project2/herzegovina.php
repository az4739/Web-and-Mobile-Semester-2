            The word Hercegovina comes from the archaic Serbo-Croatian phrase Herceg, which is derived from German Herzog (duke; Serbo-Croatian: Vojvodina) and means "duke's land" (Hercegovina). Stjepan Vukcic Kosaca, who became Herzog of Hum in 1449/50, was the
            first of the Kosaca dukes to use the title herceg instead of a duke. Ottoman soldiers finally captured the estates of Stjepan Vuki's heirs in December 1481. In 1454, the Ottomans were the first to use the name Herzegovina (Hersek) for
            the region in their administrative affairs, and in 1470, the Sanjak of Herzegovina was founded, with its first seat at Foca.

            Herzegovina and Bosnia were conquered by Austria-Hungary as a result of the Treaty of Berlin (1878), with only nominal Ottoman sovereignty surviving. East or Old Herzegovina was the ancient name for the Herzegovina region in the Principality of Montenegro.
            Herzegovina and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serb populations hoped for annexation to Serbia and Montenegro. In 1895, the Franciscan order founded Herzegovina's first university in Mostar.

        <p> The province was seized by Austria-Hungary in 1908, resulting in the Bosnian Crisis, an international dispute that narrowly avoided triggering a world war right away, and was a key stage in the development of international tensions in the
            years leading up to the First World War.
