        Overside a huge stone mosque in a corner under a fig tree, lies a factory of ćeif. A place filled with emotion, passion and enjoyment. A place where you can meet people from different sides of the world, gain new experiences and build friendships. Sounds
        too good to be true? Then you haven't experienced ćeif at Cafe De Alma. you probably don't even know what ćeif is, but don't worry, you will get to know this emotion through the experience that this coffee roasting shop offers.
    </p>

    <p>The first step: you have to find the place. There are many cracks and crannies you can wander into while exploring the Old Town in Mostar, but just one of them leads to Cafe De Alma. To help you find it you need to be very tired. You need to let
        your senses lead you to this place. The smell is your best friend. The aroma of coffee being roasted there spreads through the streets of the old town like a path. </p>

    <p> Following it, you will find yourself deep inside the shadows of a fig tree, hidden away from the unbearable Mostar heat. Next to you, a stone mosque will provide you with the privacy you need to let your guard down and enjoy a cup of coffee. As
        you enter that tight corner store filled with artifacts of time, you start to feel magic in the air. The mysterious eerie atmosphere of an empty place takes over you and you start to feel anxious. As you turn your back away trying to leave
        this now uncomfortable place, a random silhouette of a person jumps in front of you welcoming you to their shop. Comforted with an act of hospitality, the mood changes.

    </p>

    <p>You start to notice the small details this shop offers; The yellow painted walls feel warm and cozy. The sound of shaking and spinning from the coffee roasting machine becomes a pleasant background noise that fills out the unnecessary silence.
        You enter a small garden that stores only 2 tables, this is intentional as it forces people to interact. You sit down and get a cup of coffee. The whole experience of this drink cannot be described with words as it involves your whole body
        and spirit;
    </p>

    <p> All senses are stimulated in a majestic ritual traditional Bosnian coffee offers. Mixed with the chemical response that your brain has on caffeine, the ritual is healing and serves as a booster to a long day you had. Cafe de Alma is a unique and
        special Place that offers experience, rarely available anywhere else. It gathers fragile souls in need of reparation and fulfills them with a warm drink that heals. </p>

    <p>Heal your soul at Cafe de Alma.</p>
