            The city centre of Mostar is filled with nice and not so nice artefacts of the time. Landmarks that mark the historical presence of one nation in that region can be seen all over. Unfortunately, because of the war conflict that happened in the 90', there
            are many reminiscences of war in both the physical and mental state of the city. But first with the good ones.

        <p>Old Bridge obviously. A huge ottoman empire construction created in 1566 stays proud presenting the city. From this construction, the city got its name. Actually a bit more complex. The name Mostar is derived from Mostari, who were the bridge
            protectors of the time, standing on both sides of the bridge. Nowadays there are no Mostari but you can still find a piece of history in the form of jumpers that hang out on the bridge. In a way, protecting the bridge itself, jumpers are there
            working and keeping up the old lived tradition of jumping off the 27-meter high bridge.

            On top of the hill overlooking the Mostar scenery lies an orthodox synagogue. A symbol of unity the city had during its most difficult times. It is an important part of the city view because it reminds people of the history this city had. A symbol of
            unity and divergence. As you sit back and enjoy the Mostar view, the synagogue, alongside the catholic church and many mosques scattered around the city create a unique look and represent the city itself. The differences in culture, nation
            and mentalities are all bridged (bridged hehe, Mostar- The bridge city) with this panorama that unites nations.

            In the middle of the city, as a contest between life and death, lies two cultural buildings representing the city. On the left side of the square, lies an Austro-Hungarian piece of art. A huge orange Gymnasium. A history remark serving as a reminder of
            Austro-Hungarian influence in this area. Inside it, there are not one, not even 2 but 3 schools. Two of them are gymnasium high schools, one for each part of the city. Following the Bosnian / Croatian plan and program. The third school is
            a special one. UWC or the united world college put there as a patch to neutralize the national tension the building experienced.
