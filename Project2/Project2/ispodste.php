        Ispodste is a slang term for a meeting place in Mostar. It is a spot that arose by itself. Next to a river and with a beautiful view, it soon became the cultural melting point of Mostar.
    </p>

    <p>You can find everyone there. Your best friends, local fishermen, tourists, even graffiti of your parents name can be found there. Its name is a word play on a sentence “under the old bridge”, as this is exactly where it is located.

    <p>During summer, you can find yourself watching a theater play, listening to a concert or vibing to a Dj set there. It is a place where people gather to celebrate, feel blue, hang out and enjoy. The place fills out after midnight as everyone gathers
        there after all clubs are closed. Once I got a chance to perform there as a Dj. It was super fun.<a href="https://people.rit.edu/az4739/ISTE240/project1/events.html"><span>EVENTS</span></a> Under the old bridge in Mostar, two rivers combine,
        creating a beautiful beach for swimming and refreshing yourself during the hot summer days Mostar offers.
    </p>

    <p> On the other side of the Neretva river bank, there is a jumping station, put there for the bravest to swim across the fast river and jump from a 10m platform. “Ispodste” serves as a huge stage during the traditional Jumps from the old bridge.
        Lately Red bull cliff diving has joined the party of jumping off the old bridge in Mostar so under the old bridge becomes a huge red bull pit with lots of fun and a lot of free drinks.
